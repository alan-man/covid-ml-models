This project is the result of a Kaggle competition : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aresd-2023-covidchallenge/overview

##Context

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a recently discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the virus will have mild to moderate respiratory illness and will recover without the need for special treatment. The elderly and those with underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop severe disease. Throughout the pandemic, one of the major issues facing health care providers has been the lack of medical resources and an appropriate plan to distribute them effectively. In these difficult times, being able to predict the type of resources an individual may need at the time they test positive or even before that will be of immense help to authorities as they will be able to procure and organize the resources necessary to save that patient's life.

##Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that, given a Covid-19 patient's current symptoms, condition and medical history, will predict whether the patient is at high risk or not. The variable to be predicted is the variable LABEL which measures the severity of the COVID-19 infection and can take the values

SOFT_COVID : mild covid
STRONG_COVID : covid requiring heavy medical care
DEAD : fatal covid
